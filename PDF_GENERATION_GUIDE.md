# Website Design PDF Generation Guide

This guide provides multiple methods to convert your three Raytech website designs into PDFs for client presentation.

## üéØ Quick Start - Browser Method (Recommended)

### Step 1: Ensure your server is running
```bash
npm run dev
```
Your website should be accessible at `http://localhost:3001`

### Step 2: Visit each design
- **Original Design**: http://localhost:3001
- **Clean Business Design**: http://localhost:3001/design1  
- **Industrial Design**: http://localhost:3001/design2

### Step 3: Convert to PDF
For each page:

1. **Open the page in your browser**
2. **Press `Ctrl+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+P` (Mac)**
3. **Configure print settings:**
   - Destination: "Save as PDF"
   - Layout: Portrait
   - Paper size: A4
   - Margins: Minimum
   - ‚úÖ **IMPORTANT: Check "Background graphics"** (to include colors and styling)
   - ‚úÖ Check "Headers and footers" (optional, for page numbers)

4. **Save with descriptive names:**
   - `Raytech-Original-Design.pdf`
   - `Raytech-Clean-Business-Design.pdf`
   - `Raytech-Industrial-Design.pdf`

## ü§ñ Automated Method (Optional)

If you want to automate the process:

### Install Playwright
```bash
npm install playwright
```

### Run the screenshot script
```bash
npm run capture-designs
```

This will create high-quality screenshots in a `screenshots/` folder. You can then convert these to PDFs using:
- Preview app (Mac): File ‚Üí Export as PDF
- Online tools: SmallPDF, img2pdf
- Adobe Acrobat

## üìã Tips for Client Presentation

### File Naming Convention
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Include version numbers if needed
- Consider adding date: `Raytech-Design-Options-2024-07-09.pdf`

### Combining Multiple Designs
You can merge all three PDFs into one presentation:
- **Mac**: Use Preview to combine PDFs
- **Windows**: Use Adobe Reader or online PDF merge tools
- **Online**: SmallPDF, PDFtk, or similar tools

### Quality Tips
- Ensure all images and graphics are loaded before printing
- Use consistent paper size (A4 recommended)
- Include minimal margins for better content visibility
